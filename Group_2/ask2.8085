;Exercise 2
;In this exercise we going to cretate a system
;that controls automatic lights

;The main functions do the following:
;	1ST_OFF: Initial state with the switch in off state
;	1ST_ON:  waits for the switch to go off
;	2ND_OFF: turs on the lights when we turn the switch off after it was on	
;	2ND_ON ; resets the timer and keeps the lights on when we turn the 
;		  switch on and off with open lights
